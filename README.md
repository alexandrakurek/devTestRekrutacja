 # devTestRekrutacja
This is my solution to the recruitment task.
Project name: DEV-TEST.

## Description of the project
This repository contains my solutions to three Java Developer recruitment tasks.
To run this project you need: IntelliJ IDEA.

**TASK1:**
The input is a long list of integers.
This is a small app that will output the list of distinct elements sorted in ascending order, plus the basic measurement information that contains:
-  the number of elements in the source,
-   number of distinct elements,
-   min and max value.

**TASK2**
The input is a long list of integers.
This app will find all the pairs (in this integer list) that sum up to 13. Each pair in the output should have first number not greater than the second one and lines should be sorted in an ascending order.
  
**TASK3**
The first line of input contains a positive number n, next n lines contains pairs of positive integers, where each pair identifies a connection between two vertices in a graph.
This app will give us the answer for the following questions: how many separated graphs are in the input.
